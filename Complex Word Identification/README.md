# üîç Complex Word Identification (CWI) for Lexical Simplification

This project implements two approaches for identifying complex words in context, which is a crucial first step in Lexical Simplification pipelines. The goal is to predict whether a target word in a sentence is complex (challenging for a reader) or simple, based on a variety of linguistic and semantic features.

## üìö Datasets Used

- **CWI 2018 Shared Task**  
  - Domains: News, WikiNews, Wikipedia  
  - Labels: Binary and probabilistic complexity scores

- **MLSP 2024 Shared Task (LCP)**  
  - Trial split: Used for model training  
  - Test split: Used for final evaluation

---

## üß† Approaches Implemented

1. **Feature-Based MLP Classifier (PyTorch)**  
   - A multi-layer perceptron trained on handcrafted linguistic features.

2. **Soft Voting Ensemble Classifier**  
   - Combines predictions from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

## üîç Features Extracted

- **Surface Features**:  
  - Word length, syllable count, vowel/consonant ratio, capitalization, stopword flag

- **Lexical Features**:  
  - Zipf frequency, sentence length

- **Semantic Features**:  
  - WordNet relations

- **Psycholinguistic Features** (from MRC Database):  
  - Age of Acquisition (AoA), familiarity, concreteness, imagery

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Macro F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Top Misclassified Examples (Error Analysis)
